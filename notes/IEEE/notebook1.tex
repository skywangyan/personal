git clone --recursive when clone repos with submodules.\\
Maven is like Jave version Plink. Mave projects need pom.xml
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/maven}
nm -- list symbols from object file \\
nm a.out | grep main\\
jenkins groovy function name is the same with file name.\\
In the following makefile, it also has a macro defined for any libraries you want to include, such as the math library -lm. This makefile should be located in the src directory. Note that it also includes a rule for cleaning up your source and object directories if you type make clean. The .PHONY rule keeps make from doing something with a file named clean.
\begin{lstlisting}
IDIR =../include
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I$(IDIR)

ODIR=obj
LDIR =../lib

LIBS=-lm

_DEPS = hellomake.h
DEPS = $(patsubst %,$(IDIR)/%,$(_DEPS))

_OBJ = hellomake.o hellofunc.o
OBJ = $(patsubst %,$(ODIR)/%,$(_OBJ))


$(ODIR)/%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hellomake: $(OBJ)
	gcc -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm -f $(ODIR)/*.o *~ core $(INCDIR)/*~
\end{lstlisting}

make -C change to a directory before doing anything else;\\
xargs build and execute the command line.\\
under many other Unix-like systems, arbitrarily long lists of parameters cannot be passed to a command, so the command may fail with an error message of \"Argument list too long\" (meaning that the exec system call\'s limit on the length of a command line was exceeded): rm \$(find /path -type f)\\
find /path -type f -print | xargs rm

$\bullet$   {\color{red}IntelliJ} will offer the option to create new class in the new menu, only if you right click within the part of your project structure, which is marked as Sources root or Test sources root.  right click the src/main directory in the project structure view and select Mark directory As/Sources Root. That should fix it.\bigskip

\# \textbf{Java}
Set is a parent interface of all set classes like TreeSet, LinkedHashSet etc. HashSet is a class implementing Set interface. Set interface is the same.

\# \textbf{Maven}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build elements handle plugins
\item maven-jar-plugin need to specify manifest in which main class is claimed.
\item maven-compiler-plugin is needed to configured to use java vaersion 7 or higher to get rid of Maven Compilation Error: (use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator)
\end{itemize}
\# \textbf{leetCode}
\begin{itemize}
\item 737\_sentence\_similarity2, use union find to check if two words are connected, if so they are similar.
\item 734\_sentence\_similarity, use set to store counter part of a word.
\item 189\_rotate\_array, reverse array 3 times
\item 683\_k\_empty\_slot, figure out bloom day for each unit, loop through this bloom array once to find a subarray both ends are the smallest two and in the middle there are k elments.
\item 482\_license\_key\_formatting, easy, replace slash char then do the math.
\item 681\_next\_closest\_time, convert time to number of minutes, use permutation api to check todays smallest time, if there is not, use the least number in current time 4 times as next day time.
\item 686\_repeated\_string\_match, do the math, check whether the least lenth of repeated string could accommodate the target, if not add 1 and 2, if still can't return -1
\item 766\_Teoplitz\_matrix.py, check from elements of the first row and first column, iterate the diagnal line of the matrix to check if they are equal.
\item 403\_frog\_jump.py, use dp to store redundant computations for previous steps, each element in dp dict is current unit and a set of previous step coming to this unit, initially every value
  of the dict is a empty set. iterate through the dict and check if the last one is an empty set.
\item 399\_evaluate\_division.py, construct graph for each node, the product of edges from start node to end node is the outcome, if there is no such path, return -1
\item 447\_number\_of\_boomerangs, for each point, constuct a dict mapping distance and the number of points fit this distance, if number > 2, add permutation of such number to final result.
\item 212\_word\_search2.py, use a trie to do pruning in each dfs.
\item 266\_palindrome\_permutation, construct a repeat time dict, do the math.
\end{itemize}
