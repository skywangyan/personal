git clone --recursive when clone repos with submodules.\\
Maven is like Jave version Plink. Mave projects need pom.xml

nm -- list symbols from object file \\
nm a.out | grep main\\
jenkins groovy function name is the same with file name.\\
In the following makefile, it also has a macro defined for any libraries you want to include, such as the math library -lm. This makefile should be located in the src directory. Note that it also includes a rule for cleaning up your source and object directories if you type make clean. The .PHONY rule keeps make from doing something with a file named clean.
\begin{lstlisting}
IDIR =../include
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I$(IDIR)

ODIR=obj
LDIR =../lib

LIBS=-lm

_DEPS = hellomake.h
DEPS = $(patsubst %,$(IDIR)/%,$(_DEPS))

_OBJ = hellomake.o hellofunc.o
OBJ = $(patsubst %,$(ODIR)/%,$(_OBJ))


$(ODIR)/%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

hellomake: $(OBJ)
	gcc -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

.PHONY: clean

clean:
	rm -f $(ODIR)/*.o *~ core $(INCDIR)/*~
\end{lstlisting}

make -C change to a directory before doing anything else;\\
xargs build and execute the command line.\\
under many other Unix-like systems, arbitrarily long lists of parameters cannot be passed to a command, so the command may fail with an error message of \"Argument list too long\" (meaning that the exec system call\'s limit on the length of a command line was exceeded): rm \$(find /path -type f)\\
find /path -type f -print | xargs rm

That should fix it.\bigskip

\# \textbf{Java}
Set is a parent interface of all set classes like TreeSet, LinkedHashSet etc. HashSet is a class implementing Set interface. Set interface is the same.

\# \textbf{Maven}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build elements handle plugins
\item maven-jar-plugin need to specify manifest in which main class is claimed.
\item maven-compiler-plugin is needed to configured to use java vaersion 7 or higher to get rid of Maven Compilation Error: (use -source 7 or higher to enable diamond operator)


\end{itemize}
